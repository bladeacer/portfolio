## Foreword
When I first started using Obsidian, I went down the rabbit hole of
customisation, CSS snippets and all. There were plenty a useful snippet,
but not many themes integrated the snippets I liked.

### User Experience in CSS
The issue was not that there were no customisation options, it was that I had to
choose between too much or too little customisation. With my theme, I hope to
be somewhere in the middle on this spectrum.

It was a very personal choice to make a theme not only geared towards the
fanciful UI found in others, but also placing emphasis on the UX related
customisations I have grown to enjoy. I also found that dimming certain UI
elements helped me reduce information overload.

### Features in the Theme
The theme itself has some niche features like custom ASCII Art, Vim Mode status,
cursor smoothing, window animations and the list goes on. Quite a bit of the
source code is also dedicated to providing callout metadata providers.

These range from letting you change font weight to vertical alignment of text
and adding a grid background to your callouts. I can tell you about every other
feature this theme has, but I would be here all day.

tdlr[^1] there is the commonly found Rainbow Folders, colour variable
configuration and other niche features.

## Design Principles

### Font Agnostic
The overall aesthetics of the theme are terminal inspired, but should look
fine no matter your chosen font. This is due to the font agnostic nature of the theme itself.

### Sane Defaults
> There is a reasonably opinionated mode called Flex Max for users just starting
> out.
>
> For further customisation of the theme, I recommend disabling this mode and
> selecting the options you like with help from the documentation.
