## Foreword
Enter Linux, the operating system. Used in basically all supercomputers and
production servers, but does not have the best reputation in the desktop and
home PC market. It has the potential for mass appeal, especially with the
advent of initiatives like SteamOS.

### GNU Linux
Linux itself, technically speak refers to the Linux kernel by Linus Torvalds.
This is why there are "distributions" of Linux with the relevant package manager
and/or software bundled together.

The operating system itself that we come to know as "Linux", actually comprises
a large collection of free GNU software[^1]. For example, just the kernel without
GRUB or any other bootloader would not be usable. Nor would users be able to
mount their file systems, have a desktop environment and the other things that
might be taken for granted in other operating systems.

> GNU Software itself is under the Free Software Foundation (FSF), which is a
> non-profit organisation which supports the free software movement
> with its preference that software be distributed under copyleft terms.

## Linux Distributions
There are **many** Linux distributions, each with their own unique offerings.

You have distributions which work out of the box, such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint and
Fedora Linux. Then there distributions with a much higher learning curve; such
as Arch Linux, NixOS and Gentoo. Out of the three, Arch Linux is comparatively easy
to set up and troubleshoot.

However, the less beginner friendly distributions generally do not come with a GUI
installer. This specific design choice was made so that power users could fully
customise every minute detail of their operating system's installation. The trade-off
losing the familiarity and comfort of having an installation wizard like in other
Linux distributions or operating systems.

On the other hand, most Linux distributions come with a GUI installer. The
Calamares framework makes it less complicated for developers of Linux distributions
to bundle a standardised installation experience, with distribution specific settings
and other configuration possible for their users.

## Installing Software
Mobile devices have an App Store of some form, so do desktop operating systems.
What sets Linux apart is that installation of software by users is typically not
done by downloading and running some installer. Users tend to prefer that
applications provide an option to be installed with a package manager.

### Package Managers
Package managers (at least in the Linux context), are primarily command line utilities
bundled as a core dependency of the distribution of Linux one is using. There
are GUI wrappers around some package managers, though they lack in the extensibility
and flexibility that has come to be expected from package managers.

## pacman
My experiences with the pacman package manager came before I tried out Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Linux itself. When I realised that the Windows
version of Git had a Unix compatibility layer, I wanted to see what could be
achieved within said layer.

This was how I first stumbled upon the `pacman` package manager within `MSYS2`.[^2]
Unlike most other package managers, `pacman` has rather concise syntax.

For example:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S nodejs npm
```

Compared to Debian based Linux distributions:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

### Concise but meaningful
To the average user, `-Syu` seems like a random incantation of characters that
just makes `pacman` do stuff. The truth is that each flag neatly translates its
meaning (if you looked into the Arch Wiki or `pacman`'s manual page).

> `-S`: sync
>
> `-y`: refresh, `-r` is used for another purpose
>
> `-u`: upgrade

Debian's `apt` syntax is much more specific on what it is doing, although it
comes at the cost of unneeded verbosity for more experienced users.

## Conclusion
I hope that this post gives you a quick glance as to how I daily drive Linux.

[^1]: And other software, whether free, open source or proprietary.
[^2]: As for why Git's Windows version bundles said compatibility layer, it boils down to
UNIX necessities like `grep` being missing from the vanilla Windows experience. They either had
to add the compatibility layer, or lack feature parity and a consistent experience across operating systems.
